Some important algorithms in action

1. Dynamic Programming Problem 1:
In this question, we are given an array of integers and we need to calculate the maximum sum that can be generated, without including adjacent elements.

2. Dynamic Programming Problem 2: 
In this problem, we are given an array of coin denominations and a target sum and we need to find the number of ways the target sum can be achieved.
Note that, the number of coins per denomination is unlimited.
